2. The Apps
We offer various mobile applications (such as casual and hyper casual games) for all ages (“Apps”)

Note that our Apps may include local notifications that are sent to a User directly on his/her mobile device.
Certain of the Apps may permit in-app purchases, even if such Apps were downloaded for free. Such in-app purchases may not require the re-entry of credit card information as such in-app purchases will be made through an existing account with a third party distributor (such as Apple or Google ). Please note that the Apps may only be available for certain operating systems (such as iOS or Android). The User may only download and use the Apps on a device running validly licensed copies of the operating systems on which the Apps were designed to operate. To be able to access and/or use the Apps, or any portion thereof, User must legally obtain all the applicable or required facilities, utilities, software and equipment at his/her sole risk and expense.

We may make some Apps available to you at no charge and others for a fee (whether by way of in-app purchases or subscription), as described on our Apps detail pages. If such requested fees are not paid, it may result in the User not being able to access the Apps or parts thereof.

With respect to Apps that provide an option to pay periodic subscription fees: such payment will enable the User to receive access to the full version of the App (i.e., unlimited access to the full functionality of such App) and any related content updates. The User will be able to enjoy such full version of the App from any devices registered on his/her app store account, as long as his/her subscription is active. A User may cancel a subscription, however, the cancellation will not come into effect until the end of the applicable billing cycle. If the User ceases to pay the subscription fees, the User will return to the “free to play”/free trial mode, which is limited in the functionalities that are provided for free (if any). The duration, price and terms of payment of the subscriptions will appear in the applicable Apps detail pages.

Auto-renewal subscriptions: By signing up for a subscription, you agree that your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each paid subscription, unless you cancel it, and you authorize us to charge your account for the renewal term. The auto-renewal may be turned off by the User in his/her app store account settings following the first payment of the subscription fees. Deleting the App from the device does not necessarily result in cancellation of your subscription. For more information how to manage subscriptions please refer to Apple Support at: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039 or Google Support at: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&ref_topic=1689236. The download pages of auto-renewal subscription Apps will indicate the subscription’s duration, price and terms of payment. The following conditions apply with respect to auto-renewal subscription:
●  payments will be charged to User’s app store account at confirmation of purchase;

●  the subscription will automatically renew, unless the User turns off the auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current cycle (on iTunes), or chooses to cancel such subscription before the end of the current cycle (Google Play);

●  User’s AppStore account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period;

●  any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the User purchases a subscription to that App, where applicable; and

●  We may increase pricing for Users who are existing subscribers:

○   In the case of the AppStore, the Users will be asked to agree to the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.

○   In the case of Google Play, a notice will be sent to the User and the increase will apply to the next payment due from the User after the notice, provided that the User has been given at least 10 days’ prior notice before the charge is made. If the User is given less than 10 days’ prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due.

Note: We may, at our discretion, distribute Promotional Codes (defined below) which allow free use of Apps (or portions thereof). For more information, please refer to Section 26 below. We may also make some Apps available to Users for offline use. During the offline use not all functionalities will be available to the Users.
